# RuneLingual Transcript Sources - Public Directory

Welcome to the public directory of the RuneLingual Transcript Sources. This directory contains the finalized and published versions of our transcripts. These are the versions that are distributed to all RuneLingual users.

## Guidelines for the Public Directory

Please adhere to the following steps to maintain the integrity of the public directory:

1. Make initial edits and drafts in the "draft" directory.
2. Ensure there are no issues with the draft and that it's ready to be published.
3. Copy the finalized version from the draft directory to this public directory.

**Note:** Only add final versions to this directory. Files here will be downloaded by all players using RuneLingual. Ensure that the version you're adding is the latest and ready for players to use.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand our language support. If you'd like to contribute or request support for another language that isn't listed, please refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) file for more information.
